# london-airbnb-eda
Data Science personal project, using Kaggle's dataset: London Sep2022 Airbnb.

The purpose of this EDA is to understand the Airbnb scenario in London in September/2022.
Besides exploring the data, this EDA will cover the following questions:

1) What is the price distribution of Airbnb properties?
2) How do prices vary depending on how many people the property accommodates?
3) What are the most common number for minimum and maximum of nights permitted?
4) What are the cheapest and the most expensive locations for renting a property?
5) What are the most common amenities offered by the hosts?
6) What is the relation between number of reviews and the overall review rating?
7) What is the relation between a property being enabled for instant booking and number of reviews per month?
8) Do properties with shared bathrooms receive lower overall review ratings?

This dataset contains information about Airbnb properties in the London region as of September 2022. As a snapshot in time, it does not provide information on price variations over months. The dataset includes details such as nightly prices, locations, host information, reviews, property types (private or shared), amenities, and more.

Certain columns contain low-quality data and will be excluded from the analysis to ensure the integrity and reliability of the remaining dataset.
